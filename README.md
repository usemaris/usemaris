# Understand your system in minutes, not weeks.

Maris auto-generates docs, readmes, architecture diagrams, maps user flows, and answers your questions about code.

## Sound familiar?

- Kafka events get lost in the void.
- Docs are outdated or missing.
- The only devs who understood the code left years ago.

ðŸ‘‰ Thatâ€™s what Maris fixes.

## Why Maris?

- Never write docs again â€” Maris keeps them alive.
- Always-updated system diagrams from your repos.
- Ask anything about your architecture.

Documentation that never gets stale.
Understand your system today. Save days of debugging tomorrow.
